% TODO: DISCUSSION

Our study aimed to explore the effectiveness of machine learning techniques for intrusion detection in cybersecurity. Our results demonstrate that deep \acp{NN} and \acp{SVM} are the most effective models for detecting attacks with high accuracy rates, while \acp{DT} and \acp{RF} had lower accuracies. These findings are consistent with previous research in the field of intrusion detection using machine learning techniques.

One possible reason for the superior performance of deep \acp{NN} and \acp{SVM} is their ability to handle complex and high-dimensional data. In particular, deep \acp{NN} are known for their ability to learn complex patterns in data, while \acp{SVM} are effective at separating different classes of data in high-dimensional feature spaces. On the other hand, \acp{DT} and \acp{RF} may struggle with high-dimensional data and complex decision boundaries, leading to lower accuracies in our experiments.

We also found that the performance of the models varied depending on the type of attack being detected. \ac{DDoS} attacks were the most challenging to detect, while \ac{DoS} attacks were the easiest. This is consistent with previous research, which has shown that \ac{DDoS} attacks are more difficult to detect due to their distributed nature and the high volume of traffic they generate. Our results suggest that deep \acp{NN} and \acp{SVM} may be better suited for detecting \ac{DDoS} attacks, while other machine learning models may be more effective for detecting other types of attacks.

Finally, our study demonstrates that the use of feature selection techniques can further improve the accuracy of the models. \Ac{MI}-based feature selection proved to be particularly effective in our experiments, highlighting the importance of selecting relevant features for improving the performance of machine learning models.

Overall, our study provides important insights into the effectiveness of machine learning techniques for intrusion detection in cybersecurity. Our results can help guide the development of more accurate and efficient intrusion detection systems that can better protect against cyber attacks.
